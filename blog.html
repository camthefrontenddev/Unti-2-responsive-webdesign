            <h1>Responsive web design 101!</h1>
            <h4>by: Cameron Beck</h4>
			<p>You might be wondering why your beautiful website with stunning effects, comprehensive brand messaging and clear calls to action has a high bounce rate and low conversion rate. Well, my friend, there’s a good chance you have a case of — poor website speed. You know that feeling of trying waiting for a video, image files or a slow website to load? Some of the common words used are, “Ugh, why won’t this work?!” or, “This isn't worth my time…” Chances are, your customers could be feeling the same way on your website! If your website doesn't load quickly, it doesn't matter that you dominate search rankings with the right content. Let’s walk through a few simple “check engine lights” that you can use to determine if poor website speed is slowing down your business. We’ll also dive into some solutions you can incorporate to get back up to speed (pun intended).</p>
            <p>How Website Speed Affects User Experience
                    Customers hate waiting! If your load time is too long, they will bounce from your website. Or, in simpler terms, they will leave.
                    
                    <h2>What’s a normal bounce rate to have on a website?</h2>
                    <br>
                    0% – 25%: It’s most likely too good to be true. There might be something wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    26-40%: Target metric!
                    <br><br>
                    41-55%: Average. Most websites fall into this category.
                    <br><br>
                    56-75%: Much higher than average. Slow website speed might be sending people running.
                    <br><br>
                    76% – 100%: Your website needs a helicopter lift to the emergency room (this is clearly a metaphor)!</p>
